# Smart Doctor Appointment Booking App

## Project Description

Many deadly diseases are preventable and can be cured if treated at an early stage.
However, people tend to ignore the early symptoms of a disease as they are mild.
And till the time they become aware of the disease, the infection has already spread
into their body. Hence, it is always advisable to have a regular body check-up to avoid
health issues later. But due to the day-to-day busy schedule many times it is not
possible for the patients to go and get a medical appointment booked in person.
Which leads to a delay in the treatment and may cause a major health problem later.
The Online Doctor Application proposed here is an smart application that will help
the users to identify a disease based on the symptoms. When a patient enters his
/her symptoms the system will incorporate various machine learning &amp; deep learning
techniques to identify the disease. Then based on the disease identified the system
will recommend a list of doctors having expertise on that particular disease. The
patients can book an appointment with the doctors as per their preferred time &amp;
date. The patients can also chat with a doctor to get consultations.

### The needed tools and features of the project:

- An environment for entering symptoms and getting the relevant prognosis and
recommended doctor.
- An environment for booking doctors appointments.
- An environment for online chatting with doctors and getting consultation.

## Requirements

Teams should adopt the Agile development process. Project artifacts must be stored
in a public repository with issue tracking and pull request facilities (e.g., GitHub). The
team should also perform some formal project tracking, including defining milestones
in advance, assigning roles to team members, developing testing and deploying
plans, etc.

## Environment

No restrictions.
